# Bitmap Logic Simulator (Web Version)

This is a web version of the Bitmap Logic Simulator, originally invented by [realhet](https://realhet.wordpress.com/author/realhet/) and posted on [HetPas](https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/). The original version is written in Delphi XE.

The project is a simple web application using Vue.js, implementing the Bitmap Logic Simulator. The website is a single page that contains demos for the simulator and descriptions of each demo. The user can also create their own circuits and simulate them.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://david-why.tech/bmplogicsim/).
