# Bitmap Logic Simulator (Web Version)

This is a web version of the Bitmap Logic Simulator, originally invented by [realhet](https://realhet.wordpress.com/author/realhet/) and posted on [HetPas](https://realhet.wordpress.com/2015/09/02/bitmap-logic-simulator/). The original version is written in Delphi XE. The website is a single page that contains demos for the simulator and descriptions of each demo. The user can also create their own circuits and simulate them.

This project explores how logic circuits are the basis of computers and the components of computers. This is demonstrated by an implementation of computer components, such as a full 8-bit adder, and a simple 8-bit computer (*disclaimer: not written by me*) that is Turing-complete! It offers hands-on building of logic circuits through editing images that represent logic circuits, which is an interesting method of representing computer hardware and simulating it with software.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://david-why.tech/bmplogicsim/).
